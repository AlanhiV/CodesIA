To understand how Artificial Intelligence (IA) works, it is necessary to know about basic related topics. 
As an introduction about the main subject, we could get in this repository the codes related with IA permormed in Python like:
  1. Gradient Descent in implementation projects:
     1. Life expectancy case study
     2. Quality of life case study
  3. Convolutional Neural Networks as Clasifiers or Recognition of:
     1. Logical gates
     2. Faces Recognition
     3. Dog And Cats Clasifier
     4. Mexican sign lenguage (LSM) Recognition
     5. Servomotor follow of color
